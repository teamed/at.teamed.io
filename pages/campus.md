Before joining a commercial project every developer has
to complete at least ten tasks in our "campus" projects. Since all of them
are open source, you shouldn't be afraid to fail.

Once you sign a contract with us (either in oDesk or by email),
you will immediately be added to the team. Within a few days you
will receive a few tasks in one of the projects. All of them are
hosted in Github, so expect emails from there.

Your first and most important goal is to complete those tasks
as soon as possible. They give you an opportunity to see
[our management model](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) in action. Also, they give us
an opportunity to test your task-completion and communication
skills.

There are a few open source projects in the campus now:
[jcabi](https://github.com/jcabi),
[qulice](https://github.com/teamed/qulice),
[rultor](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor),
[takes](https://github.com/yegor256/takes).
