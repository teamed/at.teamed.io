The requirements are groupped by the type of the ticket they are applicable to.</p><p>When you find some issues in a ticket, make sure the performer fixes them first, before giving any mark to him/her. Remember that once you give a quality mark, the performer has no motivation any more to fix anything, becuase he/she gets the money and walks away. You should act as a barrier between the performer and the money. Don’t rush, let them work a bit and fix all quality problems possible to fix.</p><p>All tickets:</p><ul><li><p>The formatting of a ticket description, as well as all messages inside it, follows <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/">Github Markdown</a> style.</p></li><li><p>Messages in a ticket always start with a name of a user they are addressed to.</p></li></ul><p><code>TS/FIX</code> (bug fixing tickets) and <code>TS/PDD</code> (puzzle resolving):</p><ul><li><p>The ticket is closed only when the reported problem is solved, <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/12/top-down-design.html">see</a>.</p></li><li><p>Some of ticket messages must mention all pull requests where the problem was actually fixed.</p></li></ul><p><code>TS/FIX</code> (bug fixing tickets):</p><ul><li><p>Problem reporter and problem solver are two different persons, <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html#1.-keep-it-one-on-one">see</a>.</p></li><li><p>Ticket title and description clearly state what is <em>broken</em> and what kind of fix is expected, <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html#5.-report-when-it-is-broken">see</a></p></li><li><p>The ticket describes <em>one</em> specific problem and provides a <em>single</em> solution.</p></li></ul><p><code>TS/REV</code> (code review):</p><ul><li><p>Pull request title explains the problem it is fixing.</p></li><li><p>Pull request description explains the solution proposed and contains a link to the original ticket it is related to.</p></li><li><p>The code reviewer found at least <em>three problems</em> in the code.</p></li><li><p>Comments were mostly about design problems, not cosmetic issues.</p></li><li><p>All problems found by the code reviewer were addressed by the pull request author.</p></li></ul></article> <footer> <a href="mailto:hire@teamed.io" style="font-size:.8em">hire@teamed.io</a> </footer> </section></body> <script>!function(e,a,t,n,c,o,s){e.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,e[c]=e[c]||function(){(e[c].q=e[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},e[c].l=1*new Date,o=a.createElement(t),s=a.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],o.async=1,o.src=n,s.parentNode.insertBefore(o,s)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-1963507-34","auto"),ga("send","pageview")</script></html>
