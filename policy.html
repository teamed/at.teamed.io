First, you validate requirements to make sure the specification is accurate. Second, you verify that our product is in line with the specification.

A release is “published” when its status in GitHub is set to “final.” You have to ask the project owner to change the status when a new version is released and it satisfies the product owner.</p><p><span id="21" class="par"><a href="policy.html#21">§21</a></span> Each bug has to be accepted by an architect before it is paid and dispatched for fixing. As an architect, when you see a new bug submitted, inform the project manager that it is a valid bug by posting a message similar to “<em>it is a valid bug,</em>” or explain to the reporter what is wrong with the issue reported.

Urgent tasks are assigned to performers immediately. Normal tasks are assigned to performers only when the project has fewer than 10 assigned tasks. Postponed tasks are never assigned. To change any task priority, just ask a project manager with a statement like “<em>this task is urgent,</em>” or “<em>this task is postponed,</em>” or “<em>this task is not urgent anymore.</em>”</p><p><span id="27" class="par"><a href="policy.html#27">§27</a></span> As an architect, you can assign any ticket to one of the project milestones. To do that, just ask a project manager to, for example, “<em>set milestone to 1.4.</em>”</p><p><span id="29" class="par"><a href="policy.html#29">§29</a></span> As an architect, you can ask a project manager to assign any task to anyone; just say, for example, “<em>assign @yegor256.</em>”</p><p><span id="28" class="par"><a href="policy.html#28">§28</a></span> For each merged pull request, you’ll get 10 minutes if the quality is “good,” according to <a href="/qa.html">QA</a>. To motivate code reviewer to pay more attention to details, you may ask QA to give “bad” quality to the pull request. In this case, the reviewer will not be paid, while you and QA will still be paid.</p><p><span id="33" class="par"><a href="policy.html#33">§33</a></span> Every few days, projects are checked by a project manager to detect mistakes in ticket planning, milestone organization, release discipline, etc. If any problems are found, you as an architect will get 25 points docked from your rating. If no problems are found, you’ll get 120 minutes. These rules are applied: 1) All tasks are dispatched within five days; 2) The latest release is either final or less than 10 days old; 3) There are no milestones missed for more than five days; 4) No tasks are stuck (in progress for more than 20 days); 5) There are fewer than six urgent tasks.</p><p><span id="34" class="par"><a href="policy.html#34">§34</a></span> As an architect, you’ll get an extra 15 minutes for each bug reported, on top of what you get according to §12.</p><p><span id="35" class="par"><a href="policy.html#35">§35</a></span> You may be designated in Netbout as an interviewer when we recruit new programmers. Apply your best judgement and try to be objective, as <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">this article</a> suggests. When ready, post “<em>@alice verdict …</em>” to the bout, explaining your decision. No matter what your verdict is, you’ll get 15 minutes.</p><p><span id="36" class="par"><a href="policy.html#36">§36</a></span> You may ask a project manager to mark any ticket as invalid or duplicate, just say something like “<em>this is invalid</em>” or “<em>this is duplicate</em>”.</p><p><span id="37" class="par"><a href="policy.html#37">§37</a></span> You can add a boost factor to any task, just ask a project manager to do so, for example: “<em>boost factor is 2x</em>”.</p><p><span id="38" class="par"><a href="policy.html#38">§38</a></span> While the project is in <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/06/software-project-lifecycle.html#building">Building</a> phase, you’re allowed to report any time spent. You will be paid according to your reports. Just say “<em>I have spent 120 minutes for …</em>” to the project manager.</p><h2 id="quality-assurance-qa">Quality Assurance (QA)</h2><p><span id="24" class="par"><a href="policy.html#24">§24</a></span> As a QA engineer, you’ll earn 10 minutes for each ticket reviewed according to our <a href="/qa.html">quality rules</a>. You’ll get the payment right after you inform the project manager that the ticket passed the review. Your message should include your measurement of the quality, like “quality is good,” “quality is acceptable,” or “quality is bad.” No matter what remarks you make, you’ll get paid right after you post it.</p><p><span id="25" class="par"><a href="policy.html#25">§25</a></span> A ticket performer will get his or her payment only after the ticket receives your quality review. When you give a “good” mark, the performer gets a bonus. If you give an “acceptable” mark, the performer doesn’t get a bonus. When you give a “bad” mark, the performer is not paid for the ticket.</p><p>If you have any suggestions concerning this policy, please submit a ticket to <a href="https://github.com/teamed/xdsd">XDSD repo</a>.
